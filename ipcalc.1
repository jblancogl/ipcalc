.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ipcalc
is a small tool that operates on IPv4 networks.
It can operate in one of four modes: network describing,
netmask describing, finding or splitting.
When called without any flags, ipcalc operates in network
describing mode.
Options are exclusive except for -v and are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl s
Enable network splitting, the argument is a list of integers separated
by commas.
Each integer represents a number of IPs.
For each integer, ipcalc will try to find a network that is a sub network
of the main network and that can contain the number of IPs specified.
.It Fl r
Enable network finding. Ipcalc will find as few networks as possible between
the two addresses specified.
.It Fl n
Netmask describing. Ipcalc will print the netmask in all formats it knows.
.It Fl v
Operates only on network finding and splitting in which case it prints
detailed information for each network.
.It Fl c
Includes the cisco wildcard syntax in the output where applicable.
.Sh NETMASKS
Netmasks can be specified in one of three ways:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm prefix length
An integer between 1 and 32 inclusive which indicates the numbers of bits
set in the address.
.It Cm quad-dotted address
A traditionnal IPv4 address such as 255.255.255.0
.It Cm hex notation address
An address in hex notation such as 0xffffff00
